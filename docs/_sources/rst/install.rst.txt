Installation
============
This page describes the ways to install mars_time.

Local installation
------------------
To install mars_time locally, first clone the repository and then install it with this terminal command:
:code:`<path to python> -m pip install <path to setup.py>[<options]`. After that, you should be good to go!

.. note::
   This is currently the only way to install mars_time.

PyPI

If you'd like to help me make this available on PyPI, I'd be happy to collaborate!
