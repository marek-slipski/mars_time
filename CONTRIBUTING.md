1. Tell me what to change (recommended; easy for you but hard for me)
   Let me know what you want fixed by using either the Issues or Discussions
   tabs. When I can, I'll try to add/fix code based on your comments.
   
2. Do it yourself (harder for you but easy for me)
   Create a fork of this repo. Develop a particular feature on your own branch
   and submit a pull request. I'll take a look at it once you try to merge it.
