Installation
============
This page describes the ways to install mars_time.

Local installation
------------------
To install mars_time locally, first clone the repository and then install it with
:code:`<path to python> -m pip install <path to setup.py>[<options]`. After that, you should be good to go!

.. note::
   This is currently the only way to install mars_time.

PyPI
----
Currently,`mars_time is *not* available on PyPI. In the past I've found it very cumbersome to upload packages there.
If you'd like to help me make this available on PyPI, I'd be happy to collaborate!

Optional dependencies
---------------------
The following lists the optional dependencies:

* **all**: install all optional dependencies.
* **doc**: install everything related to modifying documentation.
* **test**: install everything related to modifying the code and testing these changes.
