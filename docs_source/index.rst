Mars Time
=========
:code:`mars_time` is a package for converting between Martian times and
Earth times. You may be interested in this package if:

* you want a "datetime" equivalent for Mars, or
* you're sick of people's logic-defying insistence to refer to Martian events
  in Earth times, so you want a way to convert Earth times to Martian times
  (you don't care that a global dust storm started on May 30, 2018---a date
  that provides absolutely no physically relevant info---you just want to know
  the sol or L\ :sub:`s` when it started), or
* you think in Martian times and begrudgingly have to give Earth dates and/or
  times to others.

If any of these apply to you, this package is for you.
