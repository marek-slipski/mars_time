Mars Time
=========
mars_time is a package for working with Mars times. It provides various tools for computing Mars times in the past and
future, and converting between Earth and Mars times---all to high degree of accuracy.

.. tip::
   Although I strive for a consistent API, there are situations where you may want to use a previous release. In this
   scenario, simply checkout the tagged version via Github and use the corresponding documentation from that release.
   If anyone knows of a better solution for generating documentation for an API that can potentially change, I'd be
   happy to chat!
